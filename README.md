# Hi, I'm Rodney Stanley! 👋  
**Quality Assurance Engineer → Cybersecurity & AI Security**  
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodney-stanley-sqa) | rodney_stanley@hotmail.com | Eden Prairie, MN

20+ years delivering high-quality, secure software. Now fusing deep testing expertise with hands-on cybersecurity and AI security engineering. Passionate about finding vulnerabilities before attackers do — especially in configuration and AI systems.

## 🔭 Current Project: AI-Powered Configuration Scanner
Scans infrastructure and application configuration files (YAML, JSON, ini, toml, etc.) for OWASP Top 10–style misconfigurations using a combination of rule-based tools and AI-driven anomaly detection.

- Combines traditional config auditing with large language model analysis  
- Identifies insecure defaults, excessive permissions, exposed secrets, weak encryption, and dangerous functions  
- Built with Python, Pydantic, LangChain, and open-source security rulesets  
- Future: Self-hosted agent + real-time GitHub/GitLab integration
