## 👋 Overview

I bring 20+ years of experience delivering high-quality, secure software and now apply that testing discipline to **cybersecurity and AI red-teaming**.

My focus is on systematically identifying failure modes in AI systems, documenting risk, implementing mitigations, and validating defenses through structured adversarial testing. I am especially interested in how traditional QA and abuse-case thinking translate into effective AI security practices.

I document both what works and what fails, because realistic security depends on understanding both.

Recent work focuses on detecting and mitigating crescendo-style multi-turn attacks, including cross-turn risk accumulation, decay, and post-mitigation adversarial replay.

## 🔴 AI Red Teaming & LLM Security Research
I focus on **why AI systems fail over time**, not just how they fail on a single prompt.
My work shows how multi-turn interaction, context accumulation, and misplaced trust
lead to real-world security breakdowns that single-turn testing routinely misses.

I design and execute structured AI red-team exercises against LLM-powered systems,
emphasizing realism, documentation, and defense-in-depth rather than one-off prompt tricks.

My work focuses on:
- Prompt-based adversarial testing (memory evasion, authority abuse, policy contradiction)
- Multi-turn adaptive attack scenarios, including crescendo-style escalation and cross-turn
  pressure testing
- Canonical denial design and statelessness enforcement
- Training data claim suppression
- Evidence-based mitigation and residual risk analysis
- Stateless semantic risk scoring and escalation thresholds
- Cross-turn risk accumulation with deterministic decay (no conversational memory)

### ⭐ Featured Project: AI Red Team Lab

A full end-to-end red-team exercise against a locally hosted LLM API, following a staged methodology similar to internal security assessments.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Threat modeling for LLM-backed services
- Adaptive adversarial prompt design
- Multi-turn pressure testing
- Code-level policy enforcement
- Post-mitigation retesting
- Formal security documentation

**Key Artifacts Produced:**
- Stage-based findings reports
- Mitigation and risk assessment plans
- Residual risk register
- Security posture and controls matrix
- Known limitations and non-goals
- Adversarial evasion analysis and “where I would attack next” assessment

## 🛠 Applied Security Engineering Projects

### SecureConfigAI — AI-Powered Configuration Scanner
Scans infrastructure and application configuration files (YAML, JSON, INI, TOML, etc.) for OWASP Top 10–style misconfigurations using a combination of rule-based analysis and AI-assisted review.

- Identifies insecure defaults, excessive permissions, exposed secrets, weak encryption, and dangerous functions
- Combines deterministic rules with LLM-assisted analysis
- Built with Python, Pydantic, LangChain, and open-source security rulesets
- Designed for extensibility and future CI/CD integration
